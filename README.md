This is a readme for the Portfolio assignment. I am still having some troubles commiting to Github sometimes. I also need to pratice more overall on the css layout and flexboxes as well as implementing the media queries properly.
I have made the screen responsive with a media query, I have fixed the positioning.I also added my pic,and implemented changes suggested by grader.Ihave also linked the forst 2 apps links to 2 of my live web apps.
I am adding to th readme file
